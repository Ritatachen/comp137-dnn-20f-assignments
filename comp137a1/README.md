# Comp137 DNN: Assiginment 1 

In this assignment, you will get familiar with `pytorch` and then implement a linear regression model with `pytorch`.  You need to run the notebook `linear_regression.ipynb` with the following command

> ipython notebook linear_regression.ipynb

and then follow instructions there. There are 7 problems, each of which worth 4 points. If you work out all problems correctly, you will 
get the output as `linear_regression.pdf`. 

Finally, you need to submit your code and the pdf file saved from your notebook. When we grade your code, we check your result in the pdf
file as well as your code. If your code cannot generate the result of a problem in your pdf file, you will get zero point for that problem. 
Actually, if you follow instructions in the notebook and finish all tasks, you have a very high chance to get full points.
